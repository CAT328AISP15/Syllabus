## Artificial Intelligence for Games

Artificial Intelligence is essential to make your code life-like. The course introduces a broad range of AI techniques for games. We’ll explore AI by looking at nature to understand movement, physics and steering behaviors. Then we’ll move on to through state machines, autonomous agents, genetic algorithms, neural networks and path planning. We will explore these principles through Processing, a free and programming environment. Students will complete 2 projects, several presentations, code challenges, in additional to assigned readings and exercises. 1 c.u. Prerequisite: CMP 126. 

###Course Competency

• Create life-like simulations through code
• Create systems with behaviors, movement, decision making and state machines

At the course level, the professor will evaluate student work (code) and progress through critique and written feedback. Students will evaluate how they progressed in a course. 

###Course Structure

Class will be a mix of lectures, exercises, code challenges and projects, critiques and Show & Tell. 

### Course Requirements

• Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many, etc) ONLY

• Talk to me in person about issues or problems

• Consult the [github account](https://github.com/CAT117SP15/Syllabus) for the class at least once a week for up to date information 

• Come to class on time and be familiar with the current class topics, and be ready to answer or ask questions and participate in discussions

• Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave

• Be professional at all times in your communication and attitude

• Complete all assignments by due date

• Acquire and keep up with all of the readings. Read all assigned readings before class.

• Devote at a minimum 8 to 10 hours a week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, readings and studying concepts covered in class.

### Attendance
Unexcused absences (without a note from a doctor or agency) will affect your grade. Attendance is taken at the beginning of class and is mandatory.

• One unexcused absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 points out of 100 for each additional absence.

• 3 unexcused absences is grounds for dismissal from the course.

• All presentation and critique days are mandatory.  Being absent on critique days, affects your grade for that project as well as your participation grade. Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not. Critiques can not be made up.

• Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (Email is preferred) Demonstrate time management, communication and respect.

• Be on time! Lateness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes you are late, your participation grade drops.

• Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.


### Contacting Me
Email is the preferred initial contact (katherine_bennett@bloomfield.edu). Email is suitable for short questions (to answers that cannot be found in the syllabus), to set up appointments, or to notify me about being late or absent. Emails should not be longer than 5 sentences.

For matters longer than 5 sentences, please email me to make an appointment during office hours. This is the proper way to address longer questions, issues, to ask me about an assignment, review a grade you received, or to discuss other matters. If you send me a long email, I am simply going to respond by asking you to meet with me to resolve the matter. I will not resolve matters over email.

If I have asked you to schedule an appointment with me, I am not trying to avoid you. I am offering you my full attention and preparation. Due to my schedule and other campus responsibilities, I ask you to respond to emails and to be respectful of time.

###Required Materials

We will utilize a variety of tools to make this class successful and to create your class projects.

• Texts and Readings:

	• The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman (purchase)

	• Programming Game AI by Example by Mat Buckland

	• Additional links found on github.com 

• A Github account for yourself- https://github.com/ - email me your handle

• Processing - http://processing.org/

• openFrameworks - http://www.openframeworks.cc/

• Sublime Text - http://www.sublimetext.com/2

• Proper utilization of resources outlined

Please Note: Software is either already on the computers in the lab, or free to download. 
• A hard drive

• A notebook/sketchbook and a pen. At all times.

###Important Aspects of this Course

Pair programming is a popular way to learn and to work on projects. Two people share one computer and write code together. For the second half of class, an exercise will be given which will be worked on in pairs. The exercise will be due at the end of the class period and presented to class. On occasions the deadline will be at another point. Yet, the exercise is meant to be worked on together - on one laptop, in one program. 

Homework projects will be turned in via GitHub. GitHub is a web hosting service that supports Git version control. It is more important than your resume, whether you are an artist or designer. It’s used largerly for software, but can be used for anything. It’s important to become familar with it, develop good habits (it’s like Time Machine, but better). See the assigned reading links for more information.

Time. Time management is everything. You will need it to have reasonable accomplishments in this class. The material is cumulative. The readings are essential. Writing code is the only way to make progress and to fully synthesize the material. It becomes evident quite quickly. Develop excellent time management. You will need 8-10 hours outside of class to succeed.  
Projects are not group projects.

### Technology in the Classroom

Please respect class time and the contact with me, your professor. Utilize your phones only on break. Keep  your phones on silent otherwise. If you absolutely need to take a call, please excuse yourself from class.The quality of the class depends in large part on the quality of your attention and active participation. In particular, give me and your fellow students the respect deserved. Give your full attention when students are presenting work and while I am going through lectures and demos. Continued use of cell phones or social networking sites during class time are a distraction. Students that are not respectful of class time will be asked to leave class. Course material missed is their own responsibility to cover, make-up and address. It is not the Professor’s.



### Academic Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please see the Student Handbook for further information regarding this, including procedures taken for addressing such violations.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

		practice. Her work explores the social relationships engendered when time is 
		blurred, frozen, collapsed and expanded. Her interests pertain to the non-physical 
		presence of thought and memory. Bennett widens notions of habitable spaces: 
		involving the intangible spaces within the mind and the liminal spaces created by 
		digital communities. She uses sound and light as visceral rubble to foster 
		relationships across these spaces, creating a presence across a trajectory of time. 
		Her latest environments deal with the terrain of memory - it's absence, degradation 
		and the new space that this loss provides for new experiences.
